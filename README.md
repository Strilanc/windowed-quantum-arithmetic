# Windowed quantum arithmetic

This repository contains the latex, assets, and Q# code for my paper "Windowed quantum arithmetic".
This paper shows that windowing optimizations aren't just a classical thing; they can be used to improve quantum circuits.
The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07682 .
